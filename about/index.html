<h1>about daniel moniz</h1>

<p>I'm a programmer, gamer, and writer.</p>

<p>Currently I am diving into Python to extend my base skillset beyond Java and
web technologies such as PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. If you haven't noticed,
I also believe in the Oxford Comma.</p>

<p>My current job title is Web Developer and Mathematician. I am, however,
about to be taking time off work to delve into Python and get some open source 
projects completed and online.</p>

<p>I am passionate about the open source movement in all of its forms. My long
term goals involve improving the world's access to information so that everyone
can make better decisions for themselves and their world. Most of all, however,
I am passionate about learning and teaching others.</p>

<p>You can contact me by navigating to my <a
href="http://www.github.com/danielmoniz">github repository</a>, or looking up
Daniel Moniz on LinkedIn.</p>
